									<h1>Introducing myself to the world</h1>
									<dd>My name is nia, I'm 22 years old, I was born and live in Brazil.</dd>
									<dd> <strong>I'm known on the internet as simply, kreed.</strong> </dd>
									<dd>I tend to be a gamer modder, my skills involve creating characters and rigging models. I can rig pretty much everything: humans, animals, monsters you name it! </dd>
								
								</header>
								
								<h2>The beginning</h2>
								<p>Since I was a child, games have always been my passion, I spent hours playing and the fun never ended.</p>
								<dd>I became curious about how games were made, I dove headfirst into engines like Unity, Unreal and Source, using Valve Hammer Editor.</dd>
									<dd>Over time I tried to understand how textures and materials worked, so tried to understand Photoshop and ended up with Blender.</dd>
									I never saw myself being a game developer but I always knew I had a lot of potential to do something useful, that's when I joined the modding community.</p>
									</dd>
									

									<h2>When I started</h2>
									The first game I had the pleasure of modifying was Counter-Strike 1.6, creating small changes to the maps when playing with friends, then we all started playing Left 4 Dead 2 and I thought, "why not?" So I learned how to port custom models to this game.
									<dd> A while later I realized that was making mods for all the games I played, it was like that with my favorites:</dd>
										<dd>Resident Evil 4 (2005), Resident Evil 5, Resident Evil 2,3,4 Remake, 7 Days to Die and others. </dd> </p>
									
									<h2>My beloved games</h2>
									<dd>It's a fact, I grew up playing Capcom and Valve games. Apart from L4D2 which I already mentioned, I'm also a big fan of Portal, Half-Life and Counter-Strike.</dd>
									<dd>Survival horror I simply have all Resident Evil purchased on Steam, this is just the beginning to describe how much I love the RE franchise.</dd>
									<p></p>
									
									
									<h2>Community scene</h2>
									<dd>At the beginning of 2022 I decided to join the REModding Community, a forum mainly for Resident Evil Games.</dd>
										<dd>I immediately received the “modder” tag for sharing my Resident Evil 4 (2005) mods and I didn't expect people to find the modifications I made to the game so surprising. </dd>
									<p>I loved the idea that people liked what I did, I received a lot of compliments and that encouraged me even more to learn about modding.
									<dd>I started making tutorials on how to modify RE4 and stayed in that environment for a while, after all I ended up receiving a lot of mod commissions and I paid attention to each one of them, it was becoming almost a job.</dd> 
								 </p>
									<dd>So Resident Evil 4 Remake was announced, I was in shock, my favorite game would be remade.</dd>
										<dd>I started learning how to make mods for RE Engine, thus making many ports for Resident Evil 2 and 3 Remake.</dd>
										
										At the same time as I updated my projects for RE4 (2005) I continued accepting commissions for RE2 Remake.</p>
								 	<dd>Months passed and a friend who is a big fan of Resident Evil 5 asked for my help in porting the models he had created. Until then, I had never modified this game.</dd>
										 <dd>A few days later I was releasing my first mod for RE5.</dd>
										 <dd>To this day I still receive requests for this game, as well I still have some projects in progress.</dd>
										 <p></p>

										 <h2>What's to come</h2>
										<dd>As you saw, I'm a person who runs after their goals and I don't know the word "impossible" <b><a href="https://i.imgur.com/UsG0GtE.jpg" target="_blank"> many times I proved people wrong when they said something was impossible. </a></b>
											
											I am a person who learns easily and quickly, someone willing to learn and grow more every day.</dd>
											<dd>I am a person who stays active in the community in which I was raised, I help people with difficulties in things that I had in the past and teach them to evolve just like I did.</dd>
											<p></p>
											<p>I'm searching for a place where I can use my skills, in the meantime wait for new mods and updates for my projects.</p>
